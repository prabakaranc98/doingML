# doingML

- update:
    - I am planning to log math/theoritical proofs and quick excercises and experiments around ML
    - also quick explorations on my questions / doubts

---

- current ML Recap :
   - Probabilitic Machine Learning
   - Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Theory
 
---
     
- logging my learnings and experiments on Machine Learning (theory and practice) here - mostly centered around Vapnik's work , Kevin Murphy book - and not too much of deep learning here , may be a separate repo

### Key Courses
